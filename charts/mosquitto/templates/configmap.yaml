    # Persistence
    # =================================================================

    # If persistence is enabled, save the in-memory database to disk
    # every autosave_interval seconds. If set to 0, the persistence
    # database will only be written when mosquitto exits. See also
    # autosave_on_changes.
    # Note that writing of the persistence database can be forced by
    # sending mosquitto a SIGUSR1 signal.
    #autosave_interval 1800

    # If true, mosquitto will count the number of subscription changes, retained
    # messages received and queued messages and if the total exceeds
    # autosave_interval then the in-memory database will be saved to disk.
    # If false, mosquitto will save the in-memory database to disk by treating
    # autosave_interval as a time in seconds.
    #autosave_on_changes false

    # Save persistent message data to disk (true/false).
    # This saves information about all messages, including
    # subscriptions, currently in-flight messages and retained

    # Logging
    # =================================================================

    # Places to log to. Use multiple log_dest lines for multiple
    # logging destinations.
    # Possible destinations are: stdout stderr syslog topic file dlt
    #
    # stdout and stderr log to the console on the named output.
    #
    # syslog uses the userspace syslog facility which usually ends up
    # in /var/log/messages or similar.
    #
    # topic logs to the broker topic '$SYS/broker/log/<severity>',
    # where severity is one of D, E, W, N, I, M which are debug, error,
    # warning, notice, information and message. Message type severity is used by
    # the subscribe/unsubscribe log_types and publishes log messages to
    # $SYS/broker/log/M/susbcribe or $SYS/broker/log/M/unsubscribe.
    #
    # The file destination requires an additional parameter which is the file to be
    # logged to, e.g. "log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto.log". The file will be
    # closed and reopened when the broker receives a HUP signal. Only a single file
    # destination may be configured.
    #
    # The dlt destination is for the automotive `Diagnostic Log and Trace` tool.
    # This requires that Mosquitto has been compiled with DLT support.
    #
    # Note that if the broker is running as a Windows service it will default to
    # "log_dest none" and neither stdout nor stderr logging is available.
    # Use "log_dest none" if you wish to disable logging.
    #log_dest stderr

    # Types of messages to log. Use multiple log_type lines for logging
    # multiple types of messages.
    # Possible types are: debug, error, warning, notice, information,
    # none, subscribe, unsubscribe, websockets, all.
    # Note that debug type messages are for decoding the incoming/outgoing
    # network packets. They are not logged in "topics".
    #log_type error
    #log_type warning
    #log_type notice
    #log_type information


    # If set to true, client connection and disconnection messages will be included
    # in the log.
    #connection_messages true

    # If using syslog logging (not on Windows), messages will be logged to the
    # "daemon" facility by default. Use the log_facility option to choose which of
    # local0 to local7 to log to instead. The option value should be an integer
    # value, e.g. "log_facility 5" to use local5.
    #log_facility

    # If set to true, add a timestamp value to each log message.
    #log_timestamp true

    # Set the format of the log timestamp. If left unset, this is the number of
    # seconds since the Unix epoch.
    # This is a free text string which will be passed to the strftime function. To
    # get an ISO 8601 datetime, for example:
    # log_timestamp_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S
    #log_timestamp_format

    # Change the websockets logging level. This is a global option, it is not
    # possible to set per listener. This is an integer that is interpreted by
    # libwebsockets as a bit mask for its lws_log_levels enum. See the
    # libwebsockets documentation for more details. "log_type websockets" must also
    # be enabled.
    #websockets_log_level 0


    # =================================================================
    # Security
    # =================================================================

    # If set, only clients that have a matching prefix on their
    # clientid will be allowed to connect to the broker. By default,
    # all clients may connect.
    # For example, setting "secure-" here would mean a client "secure-
    # client" could connect but another with clientid "mqtt" couldn't.
    #clientid_prefixes

    # Boolean value that determines whether clients that connect
    # without providing a username are allowed to connect. If set to
    # false then a password file should be created (see the
    # password_file option) to control authenticated client access.
    #
    # Defaults to false, unless there are no listeners defined in the configuration
    # file, in which case it is set to true, but connections are only allowed from
    # the local machine.
    allow_anonymous true

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # Default authentication and topic access control
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------

    # Control access to the broker using a password file. This file can be
    # generated using the mosquitto_passwd utility. If TLS support is not compiled
    # into mosquitto (it is recommended that TLS support should be included) then
    # plain text passwords are used, in which case the file should be a text file
    # with lines in the format:
    # username:password
    # The password (and colon) may be omitted if desired, although this
    # offers very little in the way of security.
    #
    # See the TLS client require_certificate and use_identity_as_username options
    # for alternative authentication options. If a plugin is used as well as
    # password_file, the plugin check will be made first.
    #password_file

    # Access may also be controlled using a pre-shared-key file. This requires
    # TLS-PSK support and a listener configured to use it. The file should be text
    # lines in the format:
    # identity:key
    # The key should be in hexadecimal format without a leading "0x".
    # If an plugin is used as well, the plugin check will be made first.
    #psk_file

    # Control access to topics on the broker using an access control list
    # file. If this parameter is defined then only the topics listed will
    # have access.
    # If the first character of a line of the ACL file is a # it is treated as a
    # comment.
    # Topic access is added with lines of the format:
    #
    # topic [read|write|readwrite|deny] <topic>
    #
    # The access type is controlled using "read", "write", "readwrite" or "deny".
    # This parameter is optional (unless <topic> contains a space character) - if
    # not given then the access is read/write.  <topic> can contain the + or #
    # wildcards as in subscriptions.
    #
    # The "deny" option can used to explicity deny access to a topic that would
    # otherwise be granted by a broader read/write/readwrite statement. Any "deny"
    # topics are handled before topics that grant read/write access.
    #
    # The first set of topics are applied to anonymous clients, assuming
    # allow_anonymous is true. User specific topic ACLs are added after a
    # user line as follows:
    #
    # user <username>
    #
    # The username referred to here is the same as in password_file. It is
    # not the clientid.
    #
    #
    # If is also possible to define ACLs based on pattern substitution within the
    # topic. The patterns available for substition are:
    #
    # %c to match the client id of the client
    # %u to match the username of the client
    #
    # The substitution pattern must be the only text for that level of hierarchy.
    #
    # The form is the same as for the topic keyword, but using pattern as the
    # keyword.
    # Pattern ACLs apply to all users even if the "user" keyword has previously
    # been given.
    #
    # If using bridges with usernames and ACLs, connection messages can be allowed
    # with the following pattern:
    # pattern write $SYS/broker/connection/%c/state
    #
    # pattern [read|write|readwrite] <topic>
    #
    # Example:
    #
    # pattern write sensor/%u/data
    #
    # If an plugin is used as well as acl_file, the plugin check will be
    # made first.
    #acl_file

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # External authentication and topic access plugin options
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------

    # External authentication and access control can be supported with the
    # plugin option. This is a path to a loadable plugin. See also the
    # plugin_opt_* options described below.
    #
    # The plugin option can be specified multiple times to load multiple
    # plugins. The plugins will be processed in the order that they are specified
    # here. If the plugin option is specified alongside either of
    # password_file or acl_file then the plugin checks will be made first.
    #
    # If the per_listener_settings option is false, the plugin will be apply to all
    # listeners. If per_listener_settings is true, then the plugin will apply to
    # the current listener being defined only.
    #
    # This option is also available as `auth_plugin`, but this use is deprecated
    # and will be removed in the future.
    #
    #plugin

    # If the plugin option above is used, define options to pass to the
    # plugin here as described by the plugin instructions. All options named
    # using the format plugin_opt_* will be passed to the plugin, for example:
    #
    # This option is also available as `auth_opt_*`, but this use is deprecated
    # and will be removed in the future.

    # =================================================================
    # Bridges
    # =================================================================

    # A bridge is a way of connecting multiple MQTT brokers together.
    # Create a new bridge using the "connection" option as described below. Set
    # options for the bridges using the remaining parameters. You must specify the
    # address and at least one topic to subscribe to.
    #
    # Each connection must have a unique name.
    #
    # The address line may have multiple host address and ports specified. See
    # below in the round_robin description for more details on bridge behaviour if
    # multiple addresses are used. Note that if you use an IPv6 address, then you
    # are required to specify a port.
    #
    # The direction that the topic will be shared can be chosen by
    # specifying out, in or both, where the default value is out.
    # The QoS level of the bridged communication can be specified with the next
    # topic option. The default QoS level is 0, to change the QoS the topic
    # direction must also be given.
    #
    # The local and remote prefix options allow a topic to be remapped when it is
    # bridged to/from the remote broker. This provides the ability to place a topic
    # tree in an appropriate location.
    #
    # For more details see the mosquitto.conf man page.
    #
    # Multiple topics can be specified per connection, but be careful
    # not to create any loops.
    #
    # If you are using bridges with cleansession set to false (the default), then
    # you may get unexpected behaviour from incoming topics if you change what
    # topics you are subscribing to. This is because the remote broker keeps the
    # subscription for the old topic. If you have this problem, connect your bridge
    # with cleansession set to true, then reconnect with cleansession set to false
    # as normal.
    #connection <name>
    #address <host>[:<port>] [<host>[:<port>]]
    #topic <topic> [[[out | in | both] qos-level] local-prefix remote-prefix]

    # If you need to have the bridge connect over a particular network interface,
    # use bridge_bind_address to tell the bridge which local IP address the socket
    # should bind to, e.g. `bridge_bind_address 192.168.1.10`
    #bridge_bind_address 0.0.0.0

    # If a bridge has topics that have "out" direction, the default behaviour is to
    # send an unsubscribe request to the remote broker on that topic. This means
    # that changing a topic direction from "in" to "out" will not keep receiving
    # incoming messages. Sending these unsubscribe requests is not always
    # desirable, setting bridge_attempt_unsubscribe to false will disable sending
    # the unsubscribe request.
    #bridge_attempt_unsubscribe true

    # Set the version of the MQTT protocol to use with for this bridge. Can be one
    # of mqttv50, mqttv311 or mqttv31. Defaults to mqttv311.
    #bridge_protocol_version mqttv311

    # Set the clean session variable for this bridge.
    # When set to true, when the bridge disconnects for any reason, all
    # messages and subscriptions will be cleaned up on the remote
    # broker. Note that with cleansession set to true, there may be a
    # significant amount of retained messages sent when the bridge
    # reconnects after losing its connection.
    # When set to false, the subscriptions and messages are kept on the
    # remote broker, and delivered when the bridge reconnects.
    #cleansession false

    # Set the amount of time a bridge using the lazy start type must be idle before
    # it will be stopped. Defaults to 60 seconds.
    #idle_timeout 60

    # Set the keepalive interval for this bridge connection, in
    # seconds.
    #keepalive_interval 60

    # Set the clientid to use on the local broker. If not defined, this defaults to
    # 'local.<clientid>'. If you are bridging a broker to itself, it is important
    # that local_clientid and clientid do not match.
    #local_clientid

    # If set to true, publish notification messages to the local and remote brokers
    # giving information about the state of the bridge connection. Retained
    # messages are published to the topic $SYS/broker/connection/<clientid>/state
    # unless the notification_topic option is used.
    # If the message is 1 then the connection is active, or 0 if the connection has
    # failed.
    # This uses the last will and testament feature.
    #notifications true

    # Choose the topic on which notification messages for this bridge are
    # published. If not set, messages are published on the topic
    # $SYS/broker/connection/<clientid>/state
    #notification_topic

    # Set the client id to use on the remote end of this bridge connection. If not
    # defined, this defaults to 'name.hostname' where name is the connection name
    # and hostname is the hostname of this computer.
    # This replaces the old "clientid" option to avoid confusion. "clientid"
    # remains valid for the time being.
    #remote_clientid

    # Set the password to use when connecting to a broker that requires
    # authentication. This option is only used if remote_username is also set.
    # This replaces the old "password" option to avoid confusion. "password"
    # remains valid for the time being.
    #remote_password

    # Set the username to use when connecting to a broker that requires
    # authentication.
    # This replaces the old "username" option to avoid confusion. "username"
    # remains valid for the time being.
    #remote_username

    # Set the amount of time a bridge using the automatic start type will wait
    # until attempting to reconnect.
    # This option can be configured to use a constant delay time in seconds, or to
    # use a backoff mechanism based on "Decorrelated Jitter", which adds a degree
    # of randomness to when the restart occurs.
    #
    # Set a constant timeout of 20 seconds:
    # restart_timeout 20
    #
    # Set backoff with a base (start value) of 10 seconds and a cap (upper limit) of
    # 60 seconds:
    # restart_timeout 10 30
    #
    # Defaults to jitter with a base of 5 and cap of 30
    #restart_timeout 5 30

    # If the bridge has more than one address given in the address/addresses
    # configuration, the round_robin option defines the behaviour of the bridge on
    # a failure of the bridge connection. If round_robin is false, the default
    # value, then the first address is treated as the main bridge connection. If
    # the connection fails, the other secondary addresses will be attempted in
    # turn. Whilst connected to a secondary bridge, the bridge will periodically
    # attempt to reconnect to the main bridge until successful.
    # If round_robin is true, then all addresses are treated as equals. If a
    # connection fails, the next address will be tried and if successful will
    # remain connected until it fails
    #round_robin false

    # Set the start type of the bridge. This controls how the bridge starts and
    # can be one of three types: automatic, lazy and once. Note that RSMB provides
    # a fourth start type "manual" which isn't currently supported by mosquitto.
    #
    # "automatic" is the default start type and means that the bridge connection
    # will be started automatically when the broker starts and also restarted
    # after a short delay (30 seconds) if the connection fails.
    #
    # Bridges using the "lazy" start type will be started automatically when the
    # number of queued messages exceeds the number set with the "threshold"
    # parameter. It will be stopped automatically after the time set by the
    # "idle_timeout" parameter. Use this start type if you wish the connection to
    # only be active when it is needed.
    #
    # A bridge using the "once" start type will be started automatically when the
    # broker starts but will not be restarted if the connection fails.
    #start_type automatic

    # Set the number of messages that need to be queued for a bridge with lazy
    # start type to be restarted. Defaults to 10 messages.
    # Must be less than max_queued_messages.
    #threshold 10

    # If try_private is set to true, the bridge will attempt to indicate to the
    # remote broker that it is a bridge not an ordinary client. If successful, this
    # means that loop detection will be more effective and that retained messages
    # will be propagated correctly. Not all brokers support this feature so it may
    # be necessary to set try_private to false if your bridge does not connect
    # properly.
    #try_private true

    # Some MQTT brokers do not allow retained messages. MQTT v5 gives a mechanism
    # for brokers to tell clients that they do not support retained messages, but
    # this is not possible for MQTT v3.1.1 or v3.1. If you need to bridge to a
    # v3.1.1 or v3.1 broker that does not support retained messages, set the
    # bridge_outgoing_retain option to false. This will remove the retain bit on
    # all outgoing messages to that bridge, regardless of any other setting.
    #bridge_outgoing_retain true

    # If you wish to restrict the size of messages sent to a remote bridge, use the
    # bridge_max_packet_size option. This sets the maximum number of bytes for
    # the total message, including headers and payload.
    # Note that MQTT v5 brokers may provide their own maximum-packet-size property.
    # In this case, the smaller of the two limits will be used.
    # Set to 0 for "unlimited".
    #bridge_max_packet_size 0


    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # Certificate based SSL/TLS support
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # Either bridge_cafile or bridge_capath must be defined to enable TLS support
    # for this bridge.
    # bridge_cafile defines the path to a file containing the
    # Certificate Authority certificates that have signed the remote broker
    # certificate.
    # bridge_capath defines a directory that will be searched for files containing
    # the CA certificates. For bridge_capath to work correctly, the certificate
    # files must have ".crt" as the file ending and you must run "openssl rehash
    # <path to capath>" each time you add/remove a certificate.

    #bridge_alpn

    # When using certificate based encryption, bridge_insecure disables
    # verification of the server hostname in the server certificate. This can be

    # External config files
    # =================================================================

    # External configuration files may be included by using the
